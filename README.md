## About
A theme made originally from Defaut VS Dark+ color theme, with Gruvbox Dark (Medium Contrast) flavour.

This might be only for web dev (HTML/CSS/JS) atm, the JS syntax color has been adjusted to match gruvbox for Sublime as much as possible.

Other languages haven't been tested against, but PRs are welcomed.
To contribute, please try opening sample codes from the language you're trying to use in both `vim` (or `sublime-text`) (with `Dark Medium Contrast Gruvbox`) and `vscode`, then try matching them as much as possible.

## Tips
 - `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better for syntax highlighting & (seems to) require fewer configurations
 - In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
 - VSCode's dev tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) is very helpful to find
 out the scopes.
