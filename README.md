## About
A theme made originally from Defaut VS Dark+ color theme, with Gruvbox Dark (Medium Contrast) flavour.

This might be only for web dev (HTML/CSS/JS) atm.

Other languages haven't been tested against, but PRs are welcomed.
To contribute, please try opening sample codes from the language you're trying to use in both `vim` (or `sublime-text`) (with `Dark Medium Contrast Gruvbox`) and `vscode`, then try matching them as much as possible.

## Tips
 - `tmTheme` is not being used since I think the default VS Dark+ works better for syntax highlighting & (seems to) require fewer configurations
 - In the `json` file, `scope` can be an `array` or a `string` of CSS classes
 - VSCode's dev tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) is very helpful to find
 out the scopes.
